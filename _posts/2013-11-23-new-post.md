When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? 
 
 This should be interesting. Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. Sorry, Data. I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapes? Are you up for promotion?

 Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data? The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Computer, belay that order. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves?
